## Project Description
This thesis explores the scopes and limitations of what text mining for historical analysis can reveal about the cognizant work of white settlers, slave traders, merchants, ship captains, planters, and administrators to iteratively make sense of collective enslaved resistance within a social order predicated on the production of racial difference. In turn, computational text analysis brings into view habitual grammatical constructions, such as colonial reports’ reticence to situate enslaved people as syntactic agents in accounts referencing forms of occurred or intended violent black unrest, that white authors mobilized to reinforce and reshape contingent boundaries of white subjecthood, otherness, enslaveability, and property in the eighteenth century. What can re-counting words reveal?

By engaging with such questions, this project employs digital methods to re-examine the well-trod archives of North American colonial newspapers’ coverage of collective enslaved resistance, experimentally represented by text data derived from the *South Carolina Gazette* and Virginia Gazette between the 1730s and 1770s, to investigate new dimensions in the relationship between black unrest and grammar in South Carolina and Virginia’s colonial press. I employ careful computational analysis of grammatical features alongside such sources as slave trade data, colonial legislation, and secondary scholarship to examine how the rhetoric published in the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* reflected regional, colonial, and imperial conceptions of enslaved resistance. Digital methods, which render visible relatively understudied linguistic patterns in the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette*’s reports on enslaved resistance, act as a window into how we might clarify the social and psychological processes that both disrupted and rationalized hereditary racial slavery in eighteenth century North America. Over the course of the study, I embrace digital historian Jo Guldi's methodology and theory of critical search—an enthusiastic attitude of openness to qualitative and quantitative methods that iteratively endeavors to find the best fit of data science methods for historical research—to reinforce and advance nuanced arguments about the relationship between structure of language, empire, hereditary racial slavery, and black resistance. This is the first computational study of text data derived from the eighteenth century colonial press regarding representations of collective enslaved resistance in North America and the greater Atlantic. 

To locate and isolate lexical descriptions of armed or violent black unrest, I define the rhetoric of collective enslaved resistance—a phrase I employ interchangeably with the historian Kellie Carter Jackson’s notion of black “political violence,”—as the language white authors used to describe, lament, and imagine acts of open enslaved insurrection, conspiracy scares, plots, and uprisings. Although the primary focus of this study is on the text published in the colonial press, I employ the term "political violence" in order to reflect the complex reality that resistance to slavery in the Americas was often a continuation of warfare from West Africa. Moreover, this transnational and diasporic framework has afforded historians new insights into how what was happening in West Africa among ethnic groups such as the Mande, Bullom, Temne, Vai, and Kru, shaped the trajectories of men and women's enslavement before arriving to the Carolinas and the Chesapeake regions. The complexity of captives cultural and ethnolinguistic backgrounds is reflected in diasporic communities such as the Gullah Geechee, descendants of enslaved captives from West and Central Africa who still reside in the lower Atlatnic states. Scholarship of historians such as Marcus Rediker and Vincent Brown highlight the centrality of Africa polities to the development of Atlantic warefare, enslaved resistance, and European Atlatic Empires. Witin the colonial North American press, printers also included articles and advertisements that highlighted enslaved people's methods of everyday resistance such as escape, work slowdowns, sabotage, and community cultivation. However, the language used to describe these facets of enslaved resistance are generally excluded from textual data examined in this project—but it is crucial to keep in mind that methods of black political violence and enslaved resistance in the eighteenth century were never mutually exclusive. In addition, I employ the term *black* within this study in the same vein as scholars such as Jennifer Morgan and Katherine Mckittrick, who use the term to refer not only to people from Africa and their descendants, but also to reflect the idea of the Black Atlantic. Both Morgan and Mckittrick's scholarship explore how contested conceptions of historic blackness emerged in the early modern Atlantic, charting new historiographic paths forward for the study of racial slavery and black diasporic experience.

As a case study, this project engages with contemporary discussions at the forefront of interdisciplinary scholarship at the intersections between studies of early modern slavery, enslaved resistance, colonialism, race, and capitalism and digital history, digital humanities (particularly critical black DH), and data science. However, as an experiment it remains hyper-focussed on the possibilities of close historical contextualization of even the smallest patterns that emerge through computational inquiry.
