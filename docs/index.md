# Phrasing Insurrection: A Computational Study of the Grammars of Collective Enslaved Resistance in the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* between 1732 and 1775

This respository contains the associated data and code for "Phrasing Insurrection: A Computational Study of the Grammars of Collective Enslaved Resistance in the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* between 1732 and 1775." This study explores how digital methods, such as text mining and computational corpus linguistics, can inform novel research questions and approaches to what we can know about white colonial conceptions of collective enslaved resistance in the eighteenth century. 

> “Language, incontestably, reveals the speaker. Language, also, far more dubiously, is meant to define the other—and, in this case, the other is refusing to be defined by a language that has never been able to recognize him. People evolve a language in order to describe and thus control their circumstances, or in order not to be submerged by a reality that they cannot articulate. (And, if they cannot articulate it, they are submerged.)” - James Baldwin, “If Black English Isn’t a Language, Then Tell Me, What Is?” (1979)
