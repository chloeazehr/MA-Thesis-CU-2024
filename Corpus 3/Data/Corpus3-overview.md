## CORPUS THREE DATA OVERVIEW

### Collection
Manually collected via keyword searches - based on extensive close readings and secondary research - from [History Commons](https://history-commons.net/) digital archive. This corpus contains articles from between 1732 and 1775 published in the *South Carolina Gazette* (SCG) and the *Virginia Gazette*(s) (VG) that reference resistance in the form of insurrections, conspiracies, plots, and rebellions that are not related to enslaved Africans and people of African descent. It contains 320 articles. This corpus is meant for content analysis, thus it is randomly sampled via keyword searches and contains at most 10 articles from every year (I tried to balance it by having 5 articles from the SCG and 5 from the VG for every year, however, there are a lot of years where only one paper has references to insurrections, rebellions, and conspiracies), thus it remains somewhat unbalanced.

### Variables
*NOTE: the variables in this corpus differ from Corpus 1 and Corpus 2 due to labor and time constraints.*
1. newspaper name
2. newspaper_ID_histCommons - only relevant for the *Virginia Gazette*(s) since there are multiple papers named the same thing, the number references the paper
3. printer - name of the printer
4. print_location - location of the printer
5. date - in the format YYYY_MM_DD
6. written_date - shows the date in "Month Day, Year" (this corpus contains another column with this info due to corrections)
7. year
8. text - contains the full text data of each article 
9. notes - general research notes
10. resistance_tag - lets me analyze all three corpora together and to mark which ones are related to enslaved from Africa and their descendants
