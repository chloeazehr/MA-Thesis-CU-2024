# Phrasing Insurrection: A Computational Study of the Grammars of Collective Enslaved Resistance in the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* between 1732 and 1775

This respository contains the associated data and code for "Phrasing Insurrection: A Computational Study of the Grammars of Collective Enslaved Resistance in the *South Carolina Gazette* and *Virginia Gazette* between 1732 and 1775," explores how computational methods can reshape what we know about white colonial conceptions of collective enslaved resistance in the eighteenth century. This study embraces Jo Guldi's theory of critical search and advances arguments about the relationship between grammar, empire, hereditary racial slavery, and resistance.
