This respository contains the associated data and code for "Editing Resistance: The Role of Colonial Newspapers in Shaping Perceptions of Enslaved Resistance in South Carolina and Virginia," explores how computational methods can reshape what we know about white colonial conceptions of collective enslaved resistance in the eighteenth century. This study embraces Jo Guldi's theory of critical search and advances arguments about the relationship between grammar, empire, hereditary racial slavery, and resistance.
